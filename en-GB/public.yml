# Translation information:
# 
#  - Only translate the parts in quotes "like this".
#  - All values must be kept in the same order with the same indentation and gaps.
#  - Parts of text looking like this %{code} must not be changed as they are used
#    for merging. They may be repositioned to make the sentence structure correct.
#  - Things like &copy; are HTML codes that translate to symbols on the page.
#  - \n is a code for a new line.
#  - Text surrounded by ** becomes bold (but not everywhere).
#  - URLs (links) should be kept the same.
# 
#    Thank you!
